the run_analysis.R is the script the data collect, work with, and clean a data set and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

Download the dataset:
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables:
The code assign in diferent variables the information

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
The code consolidate the information in only one dataset

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable. Appropriately labels the data set 
with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each 
subject.
